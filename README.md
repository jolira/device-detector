device-detector
==========================

A simple little Servlet that converts information stored in WURFL into JSON.

Run the ``com.jolira.detector.Start.java`` class and point your browser http://localhost:8080.
The response page contains the JSON describing what WURFL knows about your browser's useragent.

NOTE
----------------

Device-detection is really a bad idea. Use capabilities detection instead!
